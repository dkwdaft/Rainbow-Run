# more-unity-path-unity-projects
This repository contains the source code for my adaptations of   projects   from the [More Unity path](rpf.io/more-unity) created by the under a Creative Commons Licence.â€™

For each project, I have used different choices of assets  materials sounds etc from the given asset pack in most cases, in most cases, I have also added a reset button where applicable to the style of project and also set up keyboard mapping to the letter R for this function I also added movement using the arrow keys and/or W A, S, and D keys to control the marble/ marbles.
